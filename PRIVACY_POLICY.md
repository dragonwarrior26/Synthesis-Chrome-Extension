# Privacy Policy for Synthesis - AI Research Analyst

**Last Updated:** December 7, 2025

 Synthesis ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome Extension ("Synthesis") handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**Synthesis is a "Local-First" application.** We do not maintain our own servers to store your browsing history or conversation data.

### Types of Data We Process:
*   **Website Content**: When you click "Sync" or "Summarize", the extension reads the text content of the active tab to generate summaries. This data is sent directly from your browser to the Google Gemini API using your personal API Key.
*   **API Keys**: Your Google Gemini API Key is stored locally on your device using `chrome.storage.local`. It is never transmitted to us or any third party other than Google (for the purpose of making API calls).
*   **Chat History**: Your conversation history is stored locally in your browser's memory and is cleared when you close the extension or browser, unless you explicitly use a future "Save" feature (which would store it locally).

## 2. Third-Party Services

### Google Gemini API
Synthesis uses the Google Gemini API to provide AI analysis.
*   When you use the extension, the text content of the page you are viewing and your prompts are sent to Google.
*   Please refer to [Google's Generative AI Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for details on how they handle API data.
*   **We do not have access to this data.**

## 3. Data Retention
*   **Local Data**: Your API Key and preferences remain on your device until you uninstall the extension or clear your data.
*   **Server Data**: We do not have servers. We do not retain any of your data.

## 4. Your Rights
Since we do not store your data, there is nothing for us to delete. You have full control over your data by simply managing your local browser storage and API keys.
